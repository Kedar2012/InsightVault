# 💳 InsightVault – FinTech Analytics & Fraud Detection System

# 📌 Overview
InsightVault is a secure, enterprise‑grade FinTech platform designed to process and analyze financial transactions in real time.
It integrates SQL and NoSQL databases, scalable services, advanced analytics, and BI dashboards to deliver actionable insights and fraud detection capabilities.

# 🎯 Objectives
- Provide a secure transaction system with role‑based dashboards.
- Detect and flag fraudulent transactions using statistical and distributed analytics.
- Deliver real‑time performance with caching and anomaly detection.
- Offer visual insights through Power BI dashboards.
- Scale seamlessly with Docker + Kubernetes.
- Ensure code quality with pytest in CI/CD pipelines (Pylint optional).
- Enhance user experience with a chatbot assistant for onboarding and FAQs.

# 🏗️ Tech Stack
- Frontend/Admin: Django (role‑based dashboards, admin, authentication)
- APIs: Django REST Framework (REST endpoints, JWT/OAuth2 authentication)
- Databases:
- Postgres → SQL, transactional data
- MongoDB → NoSQL, logs, fraud alerts
- Redis → NoSQL, caching, real‑time flags
- Analytics: Pandas, Numpy, Spark
- Business Intelligence: Power BI
- Testing & Quality: Pytest (Pylint optional)
- Infrastructure: Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub/DockerHub
- Cloud: AWS (primary deployment), GCP optional exploration
- Monitoring: Prometheus (Grafana optional, ELK Stack optional)

# 🔄 Architecture Flow
- User Layer → Customers, Admins, Chatbot assistant
- Application Layer → Django dashboards, Django REST Framework APIs, Fraud Detection Service (Celery workers)
- Data Layer → Postgres (transactions), Redis (real‑time cache), MongoDB (logs/alerts)
- Analytics Layer → Spark, Pandas/Numpy, Power BI dashboards
- Infrastructure Layer → Docker, Kubernetes, AWS (GCP optional)
- Monitoring Layer → CI/CD pipelines, Prometheus (Grafana optional, ELK optional)

# 🚀 Features
- Transaction Management → Secure creation, validation, and storage of financial transactions
- Fraud Detection Engine → Real‑time anomaly detection powered by Spark + Redis + Celery
- Multi‑Database Integration → SQL + NoSQL hybrid for structured and unstructured data
- Analytics Dashboards → Power BI visualizations for fraud rates, transaction volumes, and risk profiles
- Chatbot Assistant → Guides new users, answers FAQs, and improves onboarding
- Scalable Deployment → Dockerized services orchestrated with Kubernetes, hosted on AWS (GCP optional)
- Observability → End‑to‑end monitoring and logging with Prometheus, Grafana optional, ELK optional
