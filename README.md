💳 InsightVault – FinTech Analytics & Fraud Detection System
📌 Overview
InsightVault is a secure, enterprise‑grade FinTech platform designed to process and analyze financial transactions in real time. It integrates SQL and NoSQL databases, scalable services, advanced analytics, and BI dashboards to deliver actionable insights and fraud detection capabilities.

🎯 Objectives
- Provide a secure transaction system with role‑based dashboards.
- Detect and flag fraudulent transactions using statistical and distributed analytics.
- Deliver real‑time performance with caching and anomaly detection.
- Offer visual insights through Power BI dashboards.
- Scale seamlessly with Docker + Kubernetes.
- Ensure code quality with pytest + pylint in CI/CD pipelines.
- Enhance user experience with a chatbot assistant for onboarding and FAQs.

🏗️ Tech Stack
- Frontend/Admin: Django (role‑based dashboards, admin, authentication)
- APIs: Django REST Framework (REST endpoints, JWT/OAuth2 authentication)
- Databases:
- Postgres (SQL, transactional data)
- MongoDB (NoSQL, logs, fraud alerts)
- Redis (NoSQL, caching, real‑time flags)
- Analytics: Pandas, Numpy, Spark
- Business Intelligence: Power BI
- Testing & Quality: Pytest, Pylint
- Infrastructure: Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub/DockerHub
- Cloud: AWS (primary deployment), GCP (secondary deployment)
- Monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack
- Chatbot: Rasa / Hugging Face models

🔄 Architecture Flow
- User Layer → Customers, Admins, Chatbot assistant
- Application Layer →
- Django (dashboards, auth, ORM, admin)
- Django REST Framework (REST APIs)
- Fraud Detection Service (Celery workers, anomaly detection)
- Data Layer → Postgres (transactions), Redis (real‑time cache), MongoDB (logs/alerts)
- Analytics Layer → Spark, Pandas/Numpy, Power BI dashboards
- Infrastructure Layer → Docker, Kubernetes, AWS/GCP
- Monitoring Layer → CI/CD pipelines, Prometheus/Grafana, ELK Stack

🚀 Features
- Transaction Management: Secure creation, validation, and storage of financial transactions.
- Fraud Detection Engine: Real‑time anomaly detection powered by Spark + Redis + Celery.
- Multi‑Database Integration: SQL + NoSQL hybrid for structured and unstructured data.
- Analytics Dashboards: Power BI visualizations for fraud rates, transaction volumes, and risk profiles.
- Chatbot Assistant: Guides new users, answers FAQs, and improves onboarding.
- Scalable Deployment: Dockerized services orchestrated with Kubernetes, hosted on AWS/GCP.
- Observability: End‑to‑end monitoring and logging for production‑grade reliability.

🧪 Testing & CI/CD
- Pytest → Unit & integration tests.
- Pylint → Code quality enforcement.
- GitHub Actions → Automated linting, testing, Docker builds, and deployments.(optional)

📊 Dashboards
- Power BI → Transaction volumes, fraud detection rates, customer segmentation.
- Grafana → System metrics (latency, throughput). (optional)
- ELK Stack → Logs and fraud alerts. (optional)

🌐 Deployment
- Local Dev → Docker Compose for all services.
- Production → Kubernetes (EKS/GKE), AWS RDS (Postgres), ElastiCache (Redis), DocumentDB/MongoDB Atlas.
- CI/CD → GitHub Actions → DockerHub/ECR → Kubernetes cluster.

📖 Future Enhancements
- Machine learning models for fraud detection (scikit‑learn, TensorFlow).
- Advanced chatbot flows (Rasa, Botpress).
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform).
- Multi‑cloud deployment (AWS + GCP).
